# ai-health-risk-dashboard
This project demonstrates how AI and data analysis can help identify early indicators of health risk based on synthetic patient data. 

## Purpose
Delayed diagnoses cost lives. This project simulates how AI can assist clinicians and patients in recognizing patterns earlier—giving people a better chance at timely intervention.

## Featured Demo: Health Risk Analysis Notebook

This project includes a [Jupyter Notebook](./health_risk_analysis_demo.ipynb) that demonstrates how AI can be applied to identify early health risk indicators using synthetic patient data.

### Notebook Highlights:
- Loads and analyzes a synthetic dataset of 100 patients
- Calculates a simple risk score based on blood pressure, glucose, BMI, age, and family history
- Flags high-risk patients for early intervention
- Includes clean visualizations and markdown explanations
- Reinforces how ethical AI can support timely, life-saving decisions

This notebook reflects a broader goal: using secure, explainable AI to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes — especially in high-risk or underserved populations.

## Features
- Sample health dataset (synthetic)
- Simple machine learning logic to flag high-risk indicators
- Dashboard-like logic using Python (Streamlit/Flask optional in future)

## Included Files
- `health_risk_analysis_demo.ipynb`: Interactive demo notebook
- `synthetic_health_data.csv`: Clean synthetic patient data

Future updates may include an interactive dashboard UI.

## Inspired By
My own experience with delayed diagnosis and systemic gaps in medical care. I'm passionate about ethical AI that prevents harm—not just reacts to it.
