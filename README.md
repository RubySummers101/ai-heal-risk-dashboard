# ai-health-risk-dashboard
This project demonstrates how AI and data analysis can help identify early indicators of health risk based on synthetic patient data. 

## Purpose
Delayed diagnoses cost lives. This project simulates how AI can assist clinicians and patients in recognizing patterns earlier—giving people a better chance at timely intervention.

## Features
- Sample health dataset (synthetic)
- Simple machine learning model to flag high-risk indicators
- Dashboard-like logic using python (streamlit/Flask optional later)

  ## Coming Soon
  - Code and notebook
  - Sample synthetic data
  - Visualizations of outcomes
 
## Inspired By
My own experience with delayed diagnosis and systemic gaps in medical care. I'm passionate about ethical AI that prevents harm—not just reacts to it.
